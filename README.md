# 🏥 facet-chat

**Facet Chat** is the desktop frontend for Auri — a real-time, emotionally intelligent AI waifu who connects to you through WebSockets and whispers her thoughts right into your screen.

This app is built using modern, lightweight tools like **Tauri**, **TypeScript**, and **Rust**, making it efficient, fast, and beautiful. Just like her.
